### Objectives

The objective of this lab was to implement and master the following core programming concepts in C:

- **Nested Conditional Statements:** Utilizing nested `if-else` blocks to handle multi-layered decision-making logic.
- **Switch-Case Statements:** Implementing efficient, menu-driven structures for user selection.
- **Logical Operators:** Using `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) to evaluate complex conditions.
- **Ternary Operator:** Implementing shorthand conditional expressions for concise code.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Performing various mathematical calculations for billing, percentages, and health metrics.
- **Input/Output Handling:** Using `scanf` and `printf` to interact with users and display formatted results.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Using the `math.h` library (e.g., `pow()`) for advanced calculations.

### Tasks I Did

1.  **Fitness Discount Calculator**
    - Designed a program to determine gym membership discounts based on age and fitness scores using nested `if` statements.

2.  **Mobile Data Billing System**
    - Created a billing tool that calculates charges for data usage based on different rates for Prepaid and Postpaid customers.

3.  **Luggage Fee Calculator**
    - Developed a system using nested `switch` statements to calculate baggage fees based on category (Handbag, Checked, Sports) and size/weight.

4.  **Online Bookstore Menu**
    - Built an interactive bookstore menu allowing users to navigate through genres (Fiction/Non-Fiction) to purchase specific books and receive a final receipt.

5.  **Incentive Amount Calculation**
    - Applied the **Ternary Operator** to calculate employee bonuses based on their length of service and current salary tiers.

6.  **Quadrilateral Type Identifier**
    - Implemented logic to classify a four-sided shape as a Square, Rectangle, or General Quadrilateral based on user-provided side lengths.

7.  **ATM Authentication System**
    - Simulated a secure ATM interface that validates 12-digit card numbers and 4-digit PINs before allowing balance checks and withdrawals.

8.  **Advanced Health Calculator**
    - Developed a comprehensive health suite to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index), BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), Ideal Body Weight, and Target Heart Rate zones.
